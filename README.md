A free and flexible online course, for new minds;) in new ways!!!<br/>
**A means to an end** for - *"relentless memorizing of lab programs, buying projects and clueless error messages".*

### Target audience
Students who are yet to start programming or those who have started and would like to strengthen their fundamentals.
People of all ages and background are welcomed.

### Possible contents 
General concepts of programming which are same across multiple programming languages are taught. But the focus is on C or C++.
Following are the possible contents from C perspective:
- Program flow
- Basic data types and operators
- Debugging
- IO operations
- Functions
- Header files
- Control flow statements
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and References
- Scope and lifetime
- Memory allocation
- Enums and Structs
- File IO operations

Along with these, few exercises and small projects will also be provided for practice.
Based on the demand, concepts of C++ can also be included.

### Outcome
Unlike most of the certification courses, the current idea is to make students self-reliant. Focus will be more on forming a solid fundamentals which clears off the doubts among students enabling them to apply their skills. After making most out of the course, the possible outcomes are
- Good foundation of programming (C or C++)
- Self-reliant in learning
- Start applying their knowledge
- Figure out errors in the code and debug
- Dead end to memorizing lab programs
- Actively take part in mini-projects

An embedded software engineer living in Germany. I started learning programming during bachelors and doing various mini-projects. Even I used to memorize my lab programs until I figured out actual concepts behind it. Once, I solidifed my basics, my interest grew towards the same enabling me to learn more things continuously with help of few people. Currently, I'm focusing on making coding fun for people, put a stop to 'memorizing lab program' concept and also to boost confidence among students enabling them to attend technical interviews with confidence and do their own projects.
